# Assignment 6

Uploading Data

# Create a form that takes a file upload where that upload can be used to import data into the database

[See Figure 1.1 and 1.2] My form prompts for an optional file to be uploaded and adds it to the user profile once submitted for administrators and advisors to review as needed.

# Create a Django admin customization that takes a file upload where that upload can be used to import data into the database

[See Figure 2] The file is then uploaded into the User Profile of the Django Admin where it can be viewed accordingly.
