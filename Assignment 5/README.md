# Assignment 5

User-Facing Forms

# Use ModelForms so that a user-facing form can be developed that captures the necessary information to capture model data

[See Figure 1.1 & 1.2] ModelForms was used to capture the first name, last name, email, Buff ID, and selected major of the user. Next, ModelForms is used to select which classes the user would like to select for their major.

# Using these ModelForms, add in a few records

[See Figure 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3] The User's input automatically creates the user into the User Profiles model with their inputted information. All of the available classes are also categorized by the degree requirement's section and available to pick.

# In a separate user-facing view, show a list of all records of each model type using dedicated individual pages or a single page.  Also include the ability to sort these records by column.

[See Figure 1.1 & 1.2]
